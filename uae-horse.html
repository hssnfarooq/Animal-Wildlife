              Horses have long played a significant part in UAE culture, as well
              as in the culture of many Arab countries. The horse has long been
              associated with chivalry, pride, and grandeur. Arabian horses were
              born and raised in the desert, where they interacted with humans
              on a regular basis. They are regarded as one of the world's oldest
              and purest horse breeds. The Arabian horse is thought to have
              originated in the Arabian Gulf. The Arabian has a distinct head
              form and a high tail carriage, making it one of the world's most
              easily recognized breeds. Arabian horses have been utilized to
              enhance other breeds by adding speed, refinement, endurance, and
              strong bones, as seen by their proliferation over the world
              through war and commerce. Arabian genetics may now be found in
              nearly every current breed of riding horse.

              There is just one species of domestic horse, yet there are around
              400 distinct varieties that specialize in everything from wagon
              hauling to racing. Horses are all grazers. While the majority of
              horses are domesticated, several remain wild. Feral horses are the
              offspring of once-tame animals that have roamed the countryside
              for centuries. Groups of these horses may be found all over the
              world. North American mustangs, for example, are descended from
              horses introduced by Europeans more than 400 years ago.

              Stables in Abu Dhabi were created in 1969 to serve as private
              stables for Shaikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan's horses. In his
              royal stables in 1980, Shaikh Zayed began a breeding program for
              what Emiratis term "asil," which means "purebred" Arabian horses.
              Shaikh Zayed had a true affection for the "asil Arabian horse,"
              and his clear affection is shared by the people of the United Arab
              Emirates. His Majesty Shaikh Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum,
              Vice-President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates and
              Ruler of Dubai, inherited a passion for horses and has achieved
              and documented a string of worldwide victories in horse racing
              contests. In 1994, he founded the Godolphin stable, named after
              his favorite Arabian horse, Godolphin, and in 2008, he received
              the Special Award of Merit at the Cartier Awards.

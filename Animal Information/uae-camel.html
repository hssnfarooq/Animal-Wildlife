              The age-old camel debate is: one hump or two? Arabian camels,
              commonly known as dromedaries, have just one hump but make good
              use of it. When food is scarce, the hump may store up to 80 pounds
              of fat, which a camel may break down into water and energy. These
              humps are responsible for camels' famous capacity to travel up to
              100 arid kilometers without water. Camels seldom sweat, even in
              desert temperatures as high as 120Â°F, so when they do consume
              fluids, they can store them for extended periods of time. Even
              desert plants may retain enough moisture in the winter to keep a
              camel alive for several weeks without water.

              Other modifications allow dromedaries to flourish in arid
              environments. They have bushy brows and two rows of long eyelashes
              to shield their eyes, and their nostrils shut to keep sand out.
              They can pick at dry and prickly desert plants because to their
              large, strong lips. Large, thick footpads assist them in
              navigating the rocky terrain and changing desert sands.

              For over 3,500 years, Arabian camels have been tamed and have long
              been appreciated as pack animals. They may go up to 25 kilometers
              per day carrying heavy loads. Some civilizations measure a
              person's wealth by the number of camels he or she owns. Today,
              virtually all camels on the planet are domesticated. They are
              native to northern Africa and southern Asia, and have recently
              been imported to Australia.

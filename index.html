          "Let us introduce ourselves. We are a group of college students who
          have been together for a looong time, we are like one team that always
          stands tall wherever you go you will find us. Our group consists of 4
          students Marwan, the adventurous one that loves Big cats like tigers
          and lions, and Hassan is the chill one that doesn't like to be annoyed
          and enjoys his time when in calm areas. He admires the sound of birds
          and nature. Syed is the naughty one, always in areas where he
          shouldn't be, and is in love with Monkeys and gorillas. last but not
          least, Ahmed is the wisest and smartest one between us always calm and
          always has the solution to our problems. Ahmed’s personality is more
          like a Crow calm and always observing what's going on around him. one
          of our biggest admiration is animals and we really like studying
          animals and understanding more about their lives and how they survive.
          so we made this website to show people and give them information on 5
          countries we focused on their most unique animals, some might be the
          national symbol for their countries and some are facing extinction and
          some that you might not even know. hope you enjoy our website and
          please don't forget to drop your feedback on the way out.

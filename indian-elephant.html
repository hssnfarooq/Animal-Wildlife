              The classification of elephants as megaherbivores and the listing
              as vulnerable, affected by habitat destruction, depletion, and
              fragmentation are both derived from one scientific study. Asian
              Elephants, which make up a majority of the population of this
              species, are located in South India and prefer grasslands,
              evergreen and semi-evergreen forests. Let us give you few facts
              about this creature, Although the trunk of this elephant has no
              bones, it is nonetheless hollow. Although there are a total of 62
              muscles in the entire human body, there are about 40,000 muscles
              on the entire trunk, which is 62 times the number of muscles in
              the human body. In addition, Indian Elephants will drink up to 200
              liters of water per day during the summer months. This strong
              drink indicates that the mammal will drink its weight nearly three
              times a month in water

              The elephant societies that have been recorded in the wild are
              called herd societies. Groups are almost all matriarchal and are
              made up of 20 closely connected female Indian elephants. The older
              females lead the parties. During the search for food and drink,
              the leader leads the entire party. These elephant species live in
              herds. For their mates, the Indian elephant has to feed for 19
              hours a day, and because of this, it creates a significant volume
              of waste – nearly 220 pounds of dung per day. They can go as much
              as 250 kilometers a day to find more nutrients. They will keep on
              their feet even though they are asleep in the wild. Indian
              elephants serve as a perfect example of how human/animal conflict
              will occur due to competition over limited resources. These
              species reside in one of the most heavily populated areas on
              Earth, where human populations continue to rise, while food and
              farmland are in increasingly short supply. As a result, elephants
              are migratory and cover vast territories, although this is
              occurring rapidly due to human development. Elephants and humans
              can come into conflict as they are forced to live with each other.
              When elephants, which are social and move in herds, trample farm
              fields, they either come to feed or fly across the fields. Once
              farmers realized that people would be taking their cattle, they
              started hunting and moved the animals to remote, scattered pockets
              of territory, surrounded by human settlements. As a result of
              these deaths every year, there are hundreds of elephants and
              civilians who are killed in these wars.

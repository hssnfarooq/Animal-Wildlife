              American alligators are found in the wild in the southeastern
              United States. They are most commonly found in Florida and
              Louisiana, where they inhabit rivers, lakes, ponds, swamps,
              bayous, and marshes. These reptiles are awkward on land, but they
              were designed for life in the water. They are excellent swimmers,
              with webbed feet and powerful tails that propel them through the
              water. A typical male American alligator measures 10 to 15 feet
              (three to five meters) in length. Its large, powerful tail
              accounts for half of its length. An alligator may weigh up to half
              a ton (1,000 pounds), although the average male weighs 500 to 600
              pounds (227 to 272 kilograms). Males are often larger than
              females.

              American alligators live almost entirely in the south eastern
              United States' freshwater rivers, lakes, swamps, and marshes,
              particularly in Florida and Louisiana. These reptiles are
              extremely well suited swimmers despite being heavy and awkward out
              of the water. Males can grow to be 10 to 15 feet tall and weigh up
              to 1,000 pounds. Females can reach a maximum height of 9.8 feet.

              Hatchlings measure 6 to 8 inches in length and have yellow and
              black stripes. Juveniles, who are prey to dozens of predators such
              as birds, raccoons, bobcats, and even other alligators, often stay
              with their moms for around two years.

              Adult alligators are apex predators that are essential to the
              biodiversity of their environment. They mostly consume fish,
              turtles, snakes, and small animals. They are, nevertheless,
              opportunists, and a hungry gator will devour almost anything, even
              carrion, pets, and, in rare cases, humans.

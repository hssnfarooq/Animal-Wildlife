              The echidna is likewise a monotreme, growing to a maximum length
              of 40 - 50 cm/ 1.4 ft and weighing around 5 - 6 kg/ 11 - 13 lbs.
              The echidna's body is coated with spines, similar to those of a
              porcupine or a hedgehog. Monotremes have a long, sticky tongue and
              feed mostly on insects. When threatened, the echidna curls itself
              into a little ball for protection. Echidna, (family
              Tachyglossidae), commonly known as spiny anteater, any of four
              strange egg-laying animals native to Australia, Tasmania, and New
              Guinea that feed and breathe through a bald tubular beak emerging
              from a spine-covered dome-shaped body. Echidnas have tiny eyes and
              slit ears, with two little noses and a small mouth at the ends of
              their beaks. Electroreceptors embedded in the surface of the beak
              may detect electrical impulses produced by invertebrate prey
              muscles. Echidnas are active day and night, probing the ground
              gradually and meticulously in search of food, although they seek
              refuge in tunnels or tunnels during the intense daytime heat.
              Echidnas, like their related the platypus, have an exceptionally
              low but changeable body temperature of 29–32 °C (84–90 °F) and are
              unable of surviving at higher temperatures. Despite their
              superficial similarity to hedgehogs, echidnas and hedgehogs are
              unrelated and belong to distinct mammalian groups. The spines, the
              number of claws on the foot, and the form and length of the beak
              all serve as distinguishing characteristics of Echidna species.

              <span class="bgt-behavior">Classification and Evolution </span>
              Echidnas belong to the family Tachyglossidae, and the platypus is
              their sole extant cousin. These animals collectively comprise the
              mammalian order Monotremata. Echidnas most likely arose during the
              Paleogene Period from an unknown monotreme progenitor (65.5 to 23
              million years ago). The absence of teeth in echidnas has
              complicated research into their evolutionary history, as teeth
              fossilize well and frequently aid in determining connections
              between animals. The world's oldest known echidna fossil was
              discovered in an eastern Australian cave deposit dating from
              around 17 million years ago (during the early Miocene Epoch).
              Although the evidence is sparse, it implies that at this period,
              essential echidna traits such as the birdlike, toothed cranium and
              powerful skeleton adapted for digging had developed. Echidnas
              appear to have been widespread and diversified in the past, with
              one particularly enormous variety reaching a length of more than
              one metre (3.3 feet). The majority of fossil echidnas from recent
              epochs are a hybrid between today's short- and long-beaked groups.

              <span class="bgt-behavior">Reproduction and life cycle </span>
              Echidnas appear to gather only during mating season, whenever a
              female may be pursued by a queue of suitors. Following around 23
              days of gestation, the female typically deposits a single leathery
              egg into a temporary pouch created by stomach muscles and
              subcutaneous mammary tissue. The egg is incubated for an
              additional ten days before hatching, aided by an egg tooth and
              fleshy bulb (caruncle) — structural remnants of the creature's
              reptilian ancestors. Young echidnas are safeguarded in an unique
              nursery burrow, where they sucking milk from unique breast hairs
              ( nipples are absent). When the newborn echidna is completely
              coated in spines and fur and is able to eat, it leaves the burrow
              and lives alone. Echidnas enjoy extremely long lives; one was
              reliably reported in the wild at 45 years of age, while one
              captive echidna was quite well over 50 years old when it died.

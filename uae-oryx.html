              The Arabian Oryx is the official national animal of the United
              Arab Emirates. It is the biggest animal found in the deserts of
              Arab countries. This species is a desert antelope that thrives in
              its harsh environment. Her gleaming white coat signifies the sun's
              rays, and her hooves resemble a paddle and spread out, allowing
              the animal to cover a large area while walking on the sandy earth.
              These creatures are known for their perseverance and elegance, and
              they have inspired many Arab writers.

              Oryx may be found in open environments such as desert,
              semi-desert, arid, and scrublands. Certain areas might become
              quite heated! But don't worry about it. Desert Oryx have an
              unusual circulation system in their brains. When you breathe, you
              chill the blood that passes from your capillaries into your brain.
              By increasing the body's temperature to 116 degrees Fahrenheit.
              The fringe-oak oryx, on the other hand, can endure periods of
              extreme heat. Instead of sweating or evaporating, the light causes
              the body to retain cooler air. When there is no shade and it is
              too humid, oryx dig low burrows to relax and cool down. The Arab
              oryx is the most knowledgeable about the desert. Its bright tint
              is represented by the desert heat and sunshine. To keep warm in
              his thick foundation on frigid winter mornings, the animal will
              elevate his fur. Even in the winter, Arab oryx legs are obscured
              to absorb part of the sun's heat. Leopards, lions, and hyenas
              employ their long oryx horns for predatory protection. When
              assaulted, gemsbok exhibits a distinctive behavior: it appears
              bigger sideways. If the opponent is defeated, the gemsbok can
              defend itself or strike with its horns.

              Oryx eats solely grass, tree and shrubs shoots, and may travel
              long distances in search of pasture. One species is expected to be
              93 kilometers long in 18 hours. They can go for extended periods
              without drinking, seeming to get their water from succulent and
              occasionally dew plants, but drink readily when water is
              available. They eat largely in the morning, at night, and maybe in
              the evening.

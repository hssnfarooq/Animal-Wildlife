              Bengal tigers are magnificent and unusual, and are one of the most
              wondrous and legendary creatures to walk the Earth. They are also
              one of the world's largest cat species. Bengals are larger than
              other tiger species on average, but the largest tiger ever
              recorded was a Siberian. As a result, Bengals are the second
              largest tiger breed. Wild Bengal tigers can now be found only in
              Bangladesh India, and Nepal. And, despite the fact that there are
              more Bengals than any other tiger subspecies on the Indian
              subcontinent, their numbers are in decline. Male tigers are
              typically 9 to 10 feet long, including the tail, and 3 to 3.5 feet
              tall from the ground. Boy Bengals weigh between 397 and 569 pounds
              on average, which is around the same as a pig and half the weight
              of a polar bear! Females are marginally taller than males. They're
              normally about 7.5 and 8.5 feet tall, and although they're the
              same height as males, they only weigh between 220 to 350 pounds,
              making them about the size of a reindeer. Bengal tigers are
              typically significantly bigger than other tiger species.

              Bengal Tigers are solitary, and use their ferocity to fiercely
              scent-mark vast areas and drive away their rivals. They are
              formidable nocturnal hunters who cover great distances in search
              of buffalo, deer, wild pigs, and other larger animals. Tigers
              conceal themselves in their conspicuous jackets (no two have the
              same stripes). They wait and crawl close enough to their prey to
              strike with a fast spring and a lethal pounce. A hungry tiger can
              consume up to 60 pounds in a single night, but they usually
              consume less. Despite their intimidating reputation, the majority
              of tigers resist humans; nevertheless, a few do grow into
              aggressive maneaters. These species are often ill and unable to
              hunt properly, or they survive in areas devoid of their
              traditional prey. Females have babies of 2 to 6 cubs, which they
              rear independently of the male. Cubs are not able to hunt until
              they reach the age of 18 months and live alongside their mothers
              for 2 - 3 years before dispersing to establish their own
              territories.

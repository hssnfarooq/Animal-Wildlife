              Bison, symbolic animals of the Great Plains, are often mistakenly
              called buffaloes. By any name, they are formidable beasts and the
              heaviest land animals in North America.

              Bison, despite their massive size, are swift on their feet. When
              necessary, they can reach speeds of up to 40 miles (65 kilometers)
              per hour. Their curving, pointed horns can reach a length of 2
              feet (61 cm). Females (cows) and mature males (bulls) normally
              live in tiny, distinct bands, but during the summer mating season,
              they congregate in very huge herds. Males compete over mating
              rights, although such bouts are rarely deadly. After a nine-month
              pregnancy, females give birth to one calf. These large grazers
              feed on plains grasses, herbs, shrubs, and twigs. They regurgitate
              their food and chew it as cud before final digestion.

              Bison formerly roamed the Great Plains and most of North America,
              and they were vital to Plains Indian communities. During the
              nineteenth century, settlers slaughtered 50 million bison for
              food, sport, and to deprive Native Americans of their most
              valuable natural resource. The once-colossal herds had been
              reduced to a few hundred animals. Bison populations have recovered
              substantially, and around 500,000 bison reside in preserves and
              ranches where they are farmed for meat.

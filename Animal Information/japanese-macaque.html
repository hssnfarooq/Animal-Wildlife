              The Japanese macaque is a terrestrial monkey. It is also called
              “snow monkey” because it inhabits areas where snow covers the
              ground for some months of the year. The monkey has a pinkish face
              and posterior with the rest of the body covered in gray hair. The
              coat is adapted to the cold area with the thickness increasing as
              the temperature decreases. The Japanese macaque is omnivorous,
              eating varieties of food including 213 species of plants, insects,
              and soil.

              Macaques from Japan live in subtropical and subalpine woods. They
              are found in cool temperate deciduous broadleaf woods in the
              northern section of their range. Temperatures in this region
              average 10.9 degrees Celsius, and annual rainfall averages 1500
              millimetres. Japanese macaques reside in evergreen broadleaf woods
              in the southern half of their natural habitat. The average
              temperature in this region is 20 degrees Celsius, while the annual
              average rainfall is 3000 millimetres. Winters are hard across
              their habitat, and Japanese macaques prefer to spend their winter
              months at lower elevations. Although they have been observed at
              elevations as high as 3180 m, they typically stay below 1800 m
              during the winter months.

                Japanese Macaques Physical Description
              </span>
              Japanese macaques are colored in a variety of shades ranging from
              brown to gray to yellowish brown. They have a vibrant face and a
              pinkish red posterior end. Their fur is extremely thick, which
              helps them stay warm during harsh winters, as they do not
              hibernate. They have a stubby, short tail. Male Japanese macaques
              are generally taller and more massive than females. Males weigh an
              average of 11.3 kg and stand 57 cm tall. Females weigh an average
              of 8.4 kg and stand 52.3 cm tall. Additionally, a correlation
              appears to exist between the body weight of Japanese macaques and
              climate. Japanese macaques in the south generally weigh less than
              those in the north, at higher elevations, where more snow
              accumulates during the winter months. Japanese macaques that have
              been provisioned have a larger skull than macaques that have not
              been provisioned. Male provisioned Japanese macaques have an
              average skull length of 134.4 mm, while females have an average
              skull length of 118.1 mm. Non-provisioned individuals have a
              slightly smaller skull, measuring an average of 129.5 mm in males
              and 115.8 mm in females.

              The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is a North American bird
              of prey. It is a sea eagle with two subspecies that form a species
              pair with the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla). Its range
              encompasses the majority of Canada and Alaska, the whole
              contiguous United States, and northern Mexico. It may be found
              around vast amounts of open water with enough of food and
              old-growth trees for nesting. The bald eagle is an opportunistic
              eater that feeds mostly on fish, which it swoops down and catches
              with its talons from the water. It has the biggest nest of any
              North American bird and the largest tree nests ever documented for
              any animal species, measuring up to 4 m (13 ft) deep, 2.5 m (8.2
              ft) broad, and weighing 1 metric ton (1.1 short tons). Sexual
              maturity is reached between the ages of four and five.

              Though their numbers have increased over most of their territory,
              bald eagles are still most common in Alaska and Canada. These
              strong birds of prey use their talons to fish, but they also
              obtain a lot of their food by scavenging carrion or taking other
              animals' carcasses. (Such larceny notably spurred Ben Franklin to
              argue against the bird's selection as the national emblem of the
              United States.) They prefer to live near water and prefer beaches
              and lakes with plenty of fish, however they may also capture and
              consume small animals.

              It is thought that bald eagles mate for life. Each year, a pair
              builds a gigantic stick nest, one of the largest in the avian
              world, high above the earth and cares for a pair of eggs. Immature
              eagles are black, and they lack the unique white markings that
              allow their parents to be identified until they are around five
              years old. Young eagles can travel long distances. Florida birds
              have been observed in Michigan, while California eagles have been
              reported as far north as Alaska.

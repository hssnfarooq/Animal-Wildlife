              In northwestern India, the Indian rhinoceros is a significant
              inhabitant. These giant beasts differ physically from their
              African ancestors in many ways. Their segmented hide resembles a
              formidable natural body armor coat. It also works in a similar
              way: the porous skin between the thicker hide "plates" helps them
              to move while the rhinoceros walks. Indian rhinos have only one
              horn, as their Latin name Rhinoceros unicornis means rhinos only
              have one horn. It is estimated that the Indian rhino weighs from
              about 1,800 and 2,700 kilograms (4,000 and 6,000 pounds). This
              creature is approximately 2.0 meters (7 feet) tall and measures
              about 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) long. While somewhat larger than the
              white rhinoceros, the Indian rhinoceros is generally considered to
              be of the same approximate size as the African rhinoceros and can
              be distinguished from the Javan rhinoceros by having a large horn,
              tubercles on its skin, and distinct skin folds.

              >
              These species are similar to most rhinos in that they have acute
              listening and a profound sense of scent. If they can smell, then
              they can locate each other by tracking the scent trails left
              behind by the gigantic animals. When aroused, an Indian rhino can
              move quickly. At 30 miles per hour, their speed is equivalent to
              their charging time. Even though they are big, they are light and
              nimble. The Indian rhino is a grazer who follows a predictable
              route through its tall-grass habitat, traveling in defined,
              tunnel-like tracks. It has a prehensile tongue, which can grasp
              tall grasses. Rhinos can be defined as grazing animals that also
              consume fruits, leaves, and even small-scale agriculture crops.
              Water and marine plants are often found in close proximity to
              where they live. To stop exerting themselves in the brutal midday
              sun, these species graze in the cooler morning and afternoon
              temperatures. They also wallow or immerse themselves in water
              while the sun is high.

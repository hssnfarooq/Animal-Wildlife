              Koalas reside in eucalypt woods along Australia's eastern coast.
              They are delicate animals that may grow to 80 cm/2.2 feet in
              height and weigh just 14 kg/31 lbs. Baby koalas are known as
              'joeys,' and they spend their first six months hiding in their
              mothers' pouch. Koalas consume a lot of eucalyptus leaves (1
              kg/2.2 lbs per day) and sleep for up to 20 hours per day! The
              small infants of most marsupials develop in pouches. A koala
              mother normally has one joey at a time. A baby koala is about the
              size of a jelly bean. The newborn, known as a joey, is blind,
              helpless, and once its born,  This small creature finds its way
              from the birth canal to its mom's pouch as soon as it is born. The
              newborn koala reaches the pouch by using its two well-developed
              senses—smell and touch—along with its powerful front legs and paws
              and an instinct that informs it which way to head. For nearly
              seven months, it remains snugly hidden away, growing and maturing.
              After around six months in the pouch, a baby's mother begins to
              create a particular material known as pap. This is fed to the joey
              in addition to the milk it currently receives. Pap is derived from
              the mother's intestines and contains bacteria that the joey
              requires in its own intestines to breakdown an adult diet of
              eucalyptus leaves. Around the age of seven months, the joey exits
              the pouch to eat leaves but returns to nurse. When the joey is
              around a year old, it quits nursing and only eats leaves.

              Koalas reside in Australia's eucalyptus woodlands. They're always
              eating when they The eucalyptus tree is also home to them. Koalas
              devour a pound of eucalyptus leaves each day. The koala needs to
              work hard to digest eucalyptus because of its poisonous
              properties. Because of this, koalas are incredibly sleepy. Cozy
              tucked in trees, koalas sleep for up to 18 to 22 hours. The water
              Koalas consume is primarily found in the leaves they eat. Leaves
              can even be stored in koala cheek pouches. It is possible to
              detect eucalyptus in their breath.

              Koala populations declined dramatically in the late nineteenth and
              early twentieth centuries due to fur harvesting. They are now
              facing grave risks from habitat loss. Clearing of land, logging,
              and bushfires—particularly the destructive 2019-2020 season—have
              devastated a large portion of the forest in which they dwell.
              Koalas require a lot of space—about a hundred trees each
              animal—which is becoming an increasingly critical issue as
              Australia's woods continue to dwindle. The International Union for
              the Conservation of Nature has designated koalas as endangered,
              naming them one of the top ten creatures most susceptible to
              climate change. Carbon dioxide increases in the atmosphere reduce
              the nutritional value of eucalyptus leaves (which is already
              relatively low) and contributes to longer, more intense droughts
              and wildfires. In reaction to dehydration, koalas are compelled to
              cease resting and descend from the trees in search of water,
              expelling valuable energy and increasing their vulnerability to
              predators.

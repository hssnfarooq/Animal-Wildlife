              There are around 50 million kangaroos in Australia, which implies
              there are far more kangaroos than people! Kangaroos are classified
              into 55 distinct species. Although wallabies are typically smaller
              than kangaroos, kangaroos exist in a variety of sizes. Some are
              extremely light and small, while others may weigh up to 90 kg/198
              lbs. Kangaroos frequent the wilderness in many rural locations.
              Pebbly Beach, a four-hour journey south of Sydney, is one of the
              greatest sites to see kangaroos. Kangaroos all have short hair,
              strong hind legs, short forelimbs, large feet, and a long tail.
              They have exceptional hearing and acute vision. Their fur coats
              can be red, grey, or light to dark brown, depending on the
              species. Kangaroos are well-known for their distinctive mode of
              locomotion: hopping! They attain speeds of up to 60kph and can
              clear more than 8m in a single leap! Their strong tail is employed
              for balance and as an additional limb as they jump. They also swim
              with their tails; yes, kangaroos are excellent swimmers! They swim
              to evade predators and are capable of drowning pursuers with their
              forepaws.

              Kangaroos, like other marsupials, have pouches where joeys are
              nurtured, receiving milk from mammary glands. Females have one
              young each year, however they can retain additional embryos
              inactive (‘embryonic diapause') until the first joey leaves the
              pouch. They may also have a joey at their feet, one in the pouch,
              and one in diapause all at once. Surprisingly, each of the
              female's four teats supplies different milk for the joeys at
              distinct phases of development. When disturbed, kangaroos hiss and
              growl, mothers create clicking noises to connect with their young,
              and males ‘chuckle' during courting! Kangaroos also are active
              between dark and dawn, searching for their favorite meals, which
              include grass, plants, ferns, flowers, fruit, and moss. They
              regurgitate their meal, eating it twice before it travels through
              their chambered stomach, just like cattle. Kangaroos require free
              water to exist; but, when desperate, they have been known to dig a
              metre-deep trench in quest of water.
